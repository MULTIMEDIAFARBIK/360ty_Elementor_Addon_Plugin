Add 360ty widgets to Elementor. Embed 360ty 360° Panorama Tours in your WordPress site using Elementor.

== Description ==
The 360ty Elementor Addon Plugin adds Widgets to Elementor, which allow you to embed 360ty Panorama Tours and customize them. It should work with other Pano2VR Tours, which were not created by us, too, but there may be some Features that won't work.

360ty uses [Appsero](https://appsero.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Appsero SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users. 

Integrating Appsero SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**
